solving https://adventofcode.com/2024 while playing around with rust

## Run

The application is built and executed using cargo (see [rerequisites](#prerequisites) for information on installation). Executing it requires passing a command line argument for the day of the puzzle to solve.

Build
```
cargo build
```

Run
```
cargo run -- <day>
```

## Prerequisites

This application has been built with `cargo new`. Follow the get-started guide here in order to run it https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started.

### Puzzle input

As the puzzle input differs by user you will need to include your own puzzle input in `./src/resources` as `.txt` file named after the day, e.g. `day1.txt`.
